            <h5 class="grey-text text-darken-3 header">Goals</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Mandarin Chinese is fun, easy and very interesting to learn.</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">It is hard to reach native-level proficiency and to be frank, it's impossible. It is not a realistic goal and nobody in their right mind should strive for that kind of goal.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">It requires many years of constant reviewing and training and for what? To sound like a native speaker? What good is that for?</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Rather, what this platform provides is training in the important speaking aspects of the language that can be used immediately on the job. You don't need to have reached "native fluency" in order to be able to use Mandarin Chinese efficiently at your job. You won't sound native, but that's OK and plus, Mandarin Chinese speaking people show the utmost respect to foreigners trying to learn their native tongue. It's amazing, here's an example.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">When I was a younger man than I am today and came to China for the first time having learnt the basics of the language I tried to order a bowl of noodles. I entered a so-called "hole in the wall" noodle shop. I came in, drops of sweat dripping down my cheeks as I murmured 你好 nǐ hǎo to greet the lady standing there. After saying it in wrong tones, in desperation I thought to myself "she might think I'm speaking Vietnamese, spit on my shoes and tell me they're closed for the day". But instead what appeared was a bright smile and a warm compliment that my Chinese was 非常好 fēicháng hǎo.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Mandarin Chinese is complicated only if you set a high expectations like sounding like a native speaker on day one, or even on day 200. Forget about it and read further to learn how to set simple and realistic goals how to learn the language in the least amount of time and yet make use of it at the job. Don't fear making mistakes, instead, make as many mistakes as you can and learn from them.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">The marketing legend Seth Godin said that "Genius is…the eventual public recognition of dozens (or hundreds) of failed attempts at solving a problem". Keep failing and you'll improve in no time.</p>


      <h5>The 5 tones of Mandarin Chinese</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language. In order to talk about complex topics in Mandarin Chinese with native speakers, tones are needed (not really, but more on that below).</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Tones are a huge part of the language and are highly emphasized in the classic classroom setting.(Very inefficient method IMO). It is good to know of them and understand how they work, but it depends on your goals with the language.</p> 
      
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">If you want to skip them. It's OK. For day to day basic communication, it is not so very important. Your friends and customers will understand what you are saying through context. Don't bother if you want to speed up the process, which is completely fine.</p> 
      
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Rather, What we recommend is: Focus on the Mandarin Chinese consonants (fancy word for sounds coming from your mouth) and get very good in the basics of the language. The training for that is provided for on this platform.</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">After that, accumulate lots of vocabulary. That's all there is to it.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">The easiest way to learn tones is to forget about them and treat them like accents. They come slowly and as time passes you'll get used to them.

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">To make things even more chaotic: Different Chinese dialects have different tones.</p>
      
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">I see students becoming too conscious of them, try too hard and end up sounding like they're hyperventilating. It's a waste of time if you only want to know basic Mandarin Chinese. They are however a crucial part of the language if you have serious plans to study further.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Here is a good video about how tones work:</p>

      <h5>Study Plan</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">On the <span class="logo-fixed-font">bamboo｜curtain</span> platform, you will see four lessons. Each lesson gradually going through different basic aspects of the language. Each lesson focused on a scenario in the travel industry. One lesson will focus on grammar and the rest is vocabulary and real life conversation examples.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">The most important part of going through this path of learning the language is using the language from day one. Make mistakes, learn from them, practice and repeat. The only reason people fail at learning languages is because they are afraid of making mistakes and afraid of sounding stupid in front of native speakers. You need to face the fact that nobody really cares. If you are not up for that challenge, go home and eat your Doritos and watch Netflix</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">However, if you are up for a little bit of suffering...</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Each lesson will take one week to master and I recommend taking eight weeks to digest the information. After that, you will be equipped with offering Mandarin Chinese speaking travelers service in their own native tongue. The more you use your new skill on the job and fail at it, the more you'll improve!</p>



      <h5>Bruce Lee said</h5>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”</p>

      <h5>What equipment is needed for the journey?</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Before starting to learn Mandarin Chinese, you absolutely need to download two free applications on your phone and/or computer. These are:</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3"><a href="https://www.pleco.com/">Pleco</a>, a revolutionary dictionary application that has changed the way people study Mandarin Chinese.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3"><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, the best Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) which is used to review characters and sentence structures you have learnt before. Spaced repetition is as important to language learning as you need to keep drinking water to stay alive. Bear that in mind.</p>
