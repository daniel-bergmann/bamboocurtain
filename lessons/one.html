            <h5 class="grey-text text-darken-3 header">The sound of Mandarin Chinese</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Firstly, we will go over how to pronounce the sounds coming from your mouth (also known as consonants) in Mandarin Chinese. Explain how the Chinese characters work and how to read them. After getting into the nitty gritty of the language we can learn something useful that you can start practicing at your job today.</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">In this video below you can get a very thorough and a fast overview of how the sounds of Mandarin Chinese sound. It also covers how to pronounce it and in which shape your tongue should be at each given time you try to pronounce a word.</p>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HtCxSLUU6s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">It is very important to take your time and focus on pronouncing the sounds as accurately as possible. Record yourself saying it and see how it sounds. If it sounds off, focus on practicing it again and again. You will eventually sound pleasant but only through deliberate practice every day.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">It's very useful to have preferably a native speaker or a longterm learner listen to your pronunciation to give you feedback. Then you can focus on bettering yourself in these sounds. Thats where you are at an advantage working in the travel industry because you can ask your Chinese speaking clients for feedback.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Learning Mandarin Chinese does not require stiff procedures where you need to sound perfect all the time. For crying out loud don't be afraid of making mistakes. Instead, just let it flow. Eventually it will sound good.</p>

      <h5>汉语拼音 Hànyǔ pīnyīn - Chinese Romanization</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">How do we know how to read Chinese characters out loud? One way is through a romanization method called 拼音 Pīnyīn. For each character, there is a Pīnyīn and a tone. There is no way to know how the character is supposed to sound like by looking at it so each and every character has to be looked up in the dictionary in order to know its pronunciation. </p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">For further clarification:</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">This is a Chinese character: 汉字</p>
      
        <p>This is its Pīnyīn: hànzì</p>

      <h5>汉字 hànzì - Chinese Characters</h5>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users. Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Unlike an alphabet, a character based writing system associates each logogram with an entire sound. Functional literacy in Chinese requires a knowledge of between 3000 and 4000 characters. If you know around 5000 characters, you can read the Peoples Daily, New York Times or Reuters in Chinese. A little bit more and you can enjoy reading a novel.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Of course, you will not need to learn that many characters to be able to use Mandarin Chinese with your clients.</p>


      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">On this platform we will use a simplified version of the Chinese characters which have been adopted in China and Singapore to increase literacy. It also happens to be used in most tourist attractions around the world as well. Chinese characters are the foundation of the language. Each character has a sound and a tone. Lets check it out!</p>

      <h5 class="grey-text text-darken-3">To start, try these out:</h5>
        <div class="card-panel">
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">你好 Nǐ hǎo - Hello</p>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">拜拜 bàibài - Bye Bye</p>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">你好吗 nǐ hǎo ma - How are you?</p>

        <P class="grey-text text-darken-3">好 hǎo - Good</P>

        <P class="grey-text text-darken-3">不好 bù hǎo - Not Good</P>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">非常好 Fēicháng hǎo - very good</p>
      </div>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">As you can see the same characters are used over and over again to say different things. That's one of the beautiful qualities of learning Mandarin Chinese. You can recycle the characters and make new words! It's kind of like Lego.</p>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Practice lesson one for a week and remember to put your newly learnt characters in your Anki flashcards app so you can practice every day.</p>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Ready for lesson two?</p>
